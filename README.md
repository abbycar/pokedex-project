# Pokeview - A cloud-based Pokedex built with Flask

This is a somewhat complex Flask app created for the [Creating a cloud-based Pokedex series](https://dev.to/googlecloud/creating-a-cloud-based-pokedex-overview-o8j). This is not an official Google product.

It includes the following features:

* Data displayed from a Cloud SQL database
* User account creation and persistent sign in
* A Pokedex for each user
* The ability for users to toggle and store the catch status of pokemon through POST requests
* Automatic scaling with App Engine once deployed
